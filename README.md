# wizard101-spoofer
Spoof your HWID on Wizard101 and log events and packets by name

# How it works
Using our packet logger, this spoofer intercepts any packets sending your MachineID to the server, and changes the data to a static randomly generated HWID

# How to update???
To update this, simply inject TestCZ, copy the code in the output, replace offsets.hpp with the generated code, and rebuild.
